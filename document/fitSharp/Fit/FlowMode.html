<div class="content">In the standard mode of story test execution, each fixture processes a single table, with the fixture name in the first cell of the table. <pre class="test">|FixtureA|
|xxx|xxx|

|FixtureB|
|xxx|xxx|</pre> Do Fixture and Sequence Fixture (and any fixture dervied from Flow Fixture Base) can also operate in flow mode, processing all the tables on the story test page without repeating the fixture name in each table. These fixtures are known as flow fixtures. When a flow fixture appears in the first cell of the first table, it operates in flow mode. <pre class="test">|FlowFixtureA|
|xxx|xxx|

|xxx|xxx|</pre> If a flow fixture appears after the first table, it operates in standard mode. <pre class="test">|FixtureA|
|xxx|xxx|

|FlowFixtureB|
|xxx|xxx|

|FixtureC|
|xxx|xxx|</pre> A fixture can "hide" itself, so that a subsequent flow fixture will appear to be in the first table, and thus operate in flow mode. <a href="../Fit/ImportFixture.html">Import Fixture</a> and <a href="../Fit/FitVersionFixture.html">Fit Version Fixture</a> are examples of hidden fixtures. The hidden fixture overrides the IsVisible property: <pre class="code">public class MyHiddenFixture: Fixture {
    public override bool IsVisible { get { return false; } }
...}</pre><pre class="test">|MyHiddenFixture|
|xxx|xxx|

|FlowFixtureA|
|xxx|xxx|

|xxx|xxx|</pre> A flow fixture can use a different rule to determine when to operate in flow mode, by overriding the IsInFlow metohd: <pre class="code">public class MyGreedyFixture: FlowFixtureBase {
    public override bool IsInFlow(int tableCount) { return true; }
...}</pre><pre class="test">|FixtureA|
|xxx|xxx|

|MyGreedyFixture|
|xxx|xxx|

|xxx|xxx|</pre><br>
